# Deep-Learning-Challenge
### Project Overview
The project aimed to develop a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the success of funding applicants for Alphabet Soup. The goal was to achieve an accuracy higher than 75%.

### Approach
- **Data Preprocessing:** Identified target variable, dropped irrelevant columns, encoded categorical variables, and scaled the data.
- **Model Design and Training:** Built neural network models with varying complexities, trained them using ReLU activation for hidden layers and sigmoid activation for the output layer, and evaluated their performance.
- **Optimization Attempts:** Explored different optimization techniques including adjusting binning, modifying neural network architectures, and increasing training epochs.

### Results
- **Model Performance:** Achieved accuracies of 72.7% and 72.4% for the two models, which did not meet the 75% target.
- **Achievements:** Despite not meeting the target accuracy, the models provided valuable insights and demonstrated proficiency in TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Recommendations:** Continue fine-tuning hyperparameters, explore more complex neural network architectures, and apply regularization techniques to improve model performance.

### Conclusion
The project developed deep learning models to predict funding applicants' success for Alphabet Soup. While the models did not meet the target accuracy, they provided valuable insights and demonstrated proficiency in TensorFlow and Keras. Future efforts should focus on further optimizing hyperparameters and exploring more complex neural network architectures.
